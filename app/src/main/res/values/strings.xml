        <item>Beagles are little hound dogs with the spirit of a bear. They are very intelligent, hardy and have incredible hunting instincts. Most beagles need a lot of training otherwise their inquisitive nature will lead them wherever it is they want to go and whenever it is they want to do it. Try this course on polite leash training to help make your walks more enjoyable.  This pup will “point” and “beagle”, translated, they pick up their paw when they are on to a scent and make a short howling noise instead of a bark. Adults can get up to 16 inches tall and weigh up to 30lbs.</item>
        <item>“Poms” are toy sized dogs. They have abundant energy, are protective and can be excellent show dogs. They are curious little things and will get into trouble if you don’t remind them of their boundaries. Like all of their other small dog peers, Pomeranian’s can exhibit symptoms of small dog syndrome if they aren’t led by a strong owner. Pom puppies are extremely fragile (three can fit in one human hand!). Adult Pom’s will sit between 8–12 inches tall and weigh up to 7lbs.</item>
        <item>Talk about some facial hair! These little long–haired pups are very active and attentive. They learn quickly, are playful and brave – but watch out for small dog syndrome. These dogs as adults can get a Napoleon complex if they aren’t consistently shown who is boss (that’s you). They can get up to almost a foot tall and usually weigh between 9–16 pounds. They will live to be an average of 15 years and need a lot of grooming.</item>
        <item>This group of dogs has over 25 different breeds. The most popular puppies you’ll run across are: American Cocker Spaniel, English springer spaniel, Welsh Springer Spaniels and Brittany Spaniels. Spaniels are best known as being gun dogs and have great, friendly temperaments. Being gun dogs, these pups are great at retrieving and are incredible companions. They typically live between 12 and 14 years.</item>
        <item>There are over 25 types of fiery and fearless terriers recognized by the American Kennel Club and they range from a tiny Norfolk (10 inches tall and between 10–12lbs) to Airedale Terriers (up to 2 feet tall and up to 65lbs). The most popular breeds are Jack Russell, Boston and Yorkshire terriers. Despite how small a terrier may be their bravery generally makes them great watchdogs. They are super independent but this in combination with courage can create some issues when bigger (not-so-easy to tackle) challenges may come their way. Terriers chase after their prey by “going to the ground”.</item>
